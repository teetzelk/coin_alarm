# coin_alarm
Read the current price of a cryptocoin and compare it to it's price from a minute prior.  If it has changed significantly then alert Telegram group (via IFTTT). 

Essentially this was to learn how to communicate with Telegram, simply, using IFTTT's webhook as well as using coinmarketcap's api.

This is my first "real" repository.  I'm just learning this Github as well as Python so I'm sure there is plenty of mistakes or long-handed programming errors (I come from an old BASIC/Visual BASIC background).
